# Plant-length-measurement
Calculate the average plant length in each plot based on the plot boundary and canopy cover layers 



Project Title

[Calculate the average plant length in each plot based on the plot boundary and canopy cover layers ]

Description

[if you have a canopy cover layer and a plot boundary layer and want to know what is the average length of plant in each plot, using this script is highly recommended]

[Call the inputs (canopy cover and plot boundary layers) and outputs (a feature layer for the results and an excel file directory). Note: There would be a field in the plot boundary with the name of PlotID with text format that shows the ID of each plot.

After running the script you can see the results layer in your defined feature layer (gdb) and also an excel file that shows the average values of plant length in each plot.
